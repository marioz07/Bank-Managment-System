## Features

1. Opening Banking Account: Users can open a new banking account by providing necessary information such as name, address, contact details, and initial deposit amount.

2. Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their existing bank account by specifying the account number and the amount to be deposited.

3. Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their existing bank account by providing the account number and the desired withdrawal amount. The system will check the account balance and perform the withdrawal if sufficient funds are available.

4. MiniStatement: Users can request a mini-statement to view the recent transactions made on their bank account. The system will display the transaction details, including date, transaction type, and amount.

5. PIN Change: Users can change their PIN (Personal Identification Number) associated with their bank account. This feature ensures enhanced security and allows users to update their PIN periodically.
